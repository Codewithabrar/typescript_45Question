//Album: Write a function called make_album()
// that builds a Object describing a music album. 
//The function should take in an artist name and an album title,
// and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
// Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
//Print each return value to show that Objects are storing 
//the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() 
//that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
//If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks,
// add that value to the albumâ€™s Object.
// Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks
// on an album.
